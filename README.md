# Libre Train Sim documentation

Please note, for the time being there will be a lot of force pushes onto the main branch. We will stop using force pushes as soon as the documentation was completely migrated.

## Language

We try to stick to British English.

1. Use unabigous language.
2. Be enjoyable to read.
3. Vvoid personal speech.
4. A confused reader is bad documentation.
5. Don't take readers for fools.
6. Strive to be as accessible as possible while retaining expressiveness.

## Page style

1. Start with a quick abstract what the page is going to teach.
2. Use tips, notes, warnings, and dangers as required. They catch readers attention.
3. Document all quirks and name them as such.
