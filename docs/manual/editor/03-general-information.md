# General Information

That article is very important. It describes, where to add your own data and scripts, and which scripts you shouldn't change at all. Also some general instructions are described.

*(If you are reading the documentation step by step, you may not understand every single point, that's okay for now)*

!!! note
    If you need a note like the one above then your docs are crap.

!!! danger "AAAARGHGHG"
    This whole page is fluff. Or like 90% of it. What do we wanna keep?

## File Structure
- **Blender**: 
- **Resources**: Here there are all Resources for the track. You could add here your own resources too, but also in a separate unique folder with your Author Name.
    - **YourTrackName**: In here all special resources for your track are saved. You have to create it.
        - **Blender**: Here you can store your .blend files. 
        - **Materials**: Here you can store specific materials for your track. (godot materials)
        - **Objects**: Here you can store your custom meshes as .obj files.
        - **RailTypes**: If you want to create own rail types, then here you could save them.
        - **SignalTypes**: If you want to create own signals, then here you cloud save them.
        - **Sounds**: Here you can store all sound files, which you need for your track. For example platforms announcments...
        - **Textures**: In here you can store Images, Textures (.png recommended) which you maybe wanna use in your materials.
    - (**Basic**: In here many assets are saved which you can use in for your own track. The License of this folder is CC0 (Public Domain)).
        - ...
- **Trains**: Here all trains are stored. Every special train his own train folder. Theoretical there some derivates of the train could be stored there too.
- **Worlds**: Here all Tracks are stored. Per track there should be a unique folder.
- **addons**: In there is the magic of Libre TrainSim. There are modules like Rails, Signals, but also the addons for GoDot saved. **Never change a script or a file in there** 

**What happens if my addon would overwrite an existing file later?**: Your "changed" file won't be effective -> That makes it easier, when a new version of Libre TrainSim comes out, that your content will run too through it.

## File Extensions
- .gd: Scripts - Written in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html) (python like)
- .tscn: Scenes *(Resouces like a train, a world, or just every other game module in GoDot Format)*
- .tres: Material/Shader/... 
- .cfg or .save: Configuration Files, which are automaticly generated by the Libre TrainSim tools, they are very important. In it chunks, scenario information and more is stored. 

## Dos:
- Reuse Materials. You are welcome to use every Resource out of /Resources/Basic. - The best thing at them: They will be updated over time. So maybe your Track looks in some newer versions better ;) As fewer materials you use, you will get a higher framerate at your track.
- Sometimes GoDot crashes, exspecially if you want to close a scene. Pro tip: 'ctrl s' is your best friend. I personally use it every 60 seconds.
- Also doing backups every day of your whole project is highly recommended. Just, if something gets wrong ;)
- Only use assets, if you have the rights for it. Best look for assets, which are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de). [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) is a nice site, where you find many assets licensed under CC0. (CC0 isn't required, but it makes a lot easier). [cc0textures](https://cc0textures.com/) has also very good textures. At the point we don't use normal maps etc, but if you want you could do this. Godot supports them.
- It is recommended to create your own assets. I recommend: [blender](https://www.blender.org/), [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- Grass Plane: The grass plane is just 10 km long. Don't worry about it. Ingame there will be an infinite grass plane. You wont have to add extra grass planes. But for editing duplicating the grass planes is no problem.

## Don'ts:
- For some objects you see in the Inspector some script variables. It is highly recommended to only change them, if it is written explicit about it in the documentation. These variables could be deprecated or just change something unpredictable.
