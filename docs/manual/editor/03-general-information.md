# General Information

!!! note "Docs merging note"
    This page can be deleted or merged into another one. Moved file structure. Removed false advise. Unsure what to do with the rest.

## Dos
- Save often, save early.
- Use version control or at least backup your files regularly.
- Only use assets, if you have the rights for it. Best look for assets, which are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de). [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) is a nice site, where you find many assets licensed under CC0. (CC0 isn't required, but it makes a lot easier). [cc0textures](https://cc0textures.com/) has also very good textures. At the point we don't use normal maps etc, but if you want you could do this. Godot supports them.

## Don'ts
- Giving it up - If you have problem feel free to open a new issue. Together we will solve your Problem: [Click Here](https://github.com/Libre-TrainSim/Libre-TrainSim/issues/new). Feel free to contact Jean via Discord: https://www.libre-trainsim.de/links
