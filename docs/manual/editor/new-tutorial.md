# A new tutorial

The old tutorial doesn't teach well and is hard to improve.
Let's try a newly structured one.

**This is a step by step tutorial for the editor!**
The modding section should get a step by step tutorial, too. Additionally, we should aim to provide a reference style manual that showcases single features and their use cases when being looked up.

Concepts should be introduced in a recurring pattern so they are easily understandable throughout the manual. New terms should be explained. These explanations should be collected in a single page.
