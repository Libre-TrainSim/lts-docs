# File Structure

We're moving to a new structure. This process is done one step at a time and not immediate. If you're creating new files, please stick to `underscore_naming`. It prevents accidentally duplicated files.

## File Structure
- **Blender**: 
- **Resources**: Here there are all Resources for the track. You could add here your own resources too, but also in a separate unique folder with your Author Name.
    - **YourTrackName**: In here all special resources for your track are saved. You have to create it.
        - **Blender**: Here you can store your .blend files. 
        - **Materials**: Here you can store specific materials for your track. (godot materials)
        - **Objects**: Here you can store your custom meshes as .obj files.
        - **RailTypes**: If you want to create own rail types, then here you could save them.
        - **SignalTypes**: If you want to create own signals, then here you cloud save them.
        - **Sounds**: Here you can store all sound files, which you need for your track. For example platforms announcments...
        - **Textures**: In here you can store Images, Textures (.png recommended) which you maybe wanna use in your materials.
    - (**Basic**: In here many assets are saved which you can use in for your own track. The License of this folder is CC0 (Public Domain)).
        - ...
- **Trains**: Here all trains are stored. Every special train his own train folder. Theoretical there some derivates of the train could be stored there too.
- **Worlds**: Here all Tracks are stored. Per track there should be a unique folder.
- **addons**: In there is the magic of Libre TrainSim. There are modules like Rails, Signals, but also the addons for Godot saved. **Never change a script or a file in there** 

**What happens if my addon would overwrite an existing file later?**: Your "changed" file won't be effective -> That makes it easier, when a new version of Libre TrainSim comes out, that your content will run too through it.

## File Extensions
- .gd: Scripts - Written in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html)
- .tscn: Scenes *(Resouces like a train, a world, or just every other game module in Godot Format)*
- .tres: Material/Shader/... 
- .cfg or .save: Configuration Files, which are automaticly generated by the Libre TrainSim tools, they are very important. In it chunks, scenario information and more is stored.
